# LIRIbot

In this assignment I've created a LIRI, which is like iPhone's SIRI. It differs from SIRI by being a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface rather than a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. Data returned will come from Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

This is a Javascript/jQuery/nodeJS project for the UMN Coding Bootcamp, assignment 8. 



## Getting Started

To utilize this project, I access my LIRIbot files via my terminal. From there, I can search for songs, concerts, and movies via using node commands as "concert-this", "spotify-this-song", "movie-this", and "do-what-it-says".

### Installing

First, 
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
